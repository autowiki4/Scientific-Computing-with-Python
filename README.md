# FCC-Projects
Free Code Camp Projects on Scientific Computing with Python

# Arithmetic Formatter - FCC_Proj1
**Description:** Developed a Python program to format arithmetic problems vertically, mimicking the layout used by students to solve math problems.

**Skills:** String manipulation, conditional logic, optional argument handling.

# Time Calculator - FCC_Proj2
**Description:** Built a Python function that adds a duration to a start time in a 12-hour format, optionally returning the day of the week and handling multi-day outputs.

**Skills:** Date and time calculations, string manipulation, control flow.

# Budget App - FCC_Proj3
**Description:** Created a budget management app that tracks deposits and withdrawals across different categories, includes fund transfer between categories, and displays category balances.

**Skills:** Object-oriented programming, class methods, data structures (lists, dictionaries).

# Polygon Area Calculator - FCC_Proj4
**Description:** Developed a Python program with a Rectangle class and a Square subclass to calculate area, perimeter, and the number of times one shape can fit inside another.

**Skills:** Object-oriented programming, inheritance, geometric calculations.

# Probability Calculator - FCC_Proj5
**Description:** Simulated probability experiments using a Hat class to determine the likelihood of drawing specific combinations of colored balls from a hat.

**Skills:** Simulation, random sampling, probability theory, object-oriented programming.
